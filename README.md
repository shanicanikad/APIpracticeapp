CoverGirl Cosmetics

Welcome to the CoverGirl Cosmetics Page!

Here, (https://shanicanikad.github.io/APIpracticeapp/#/), the user is directed to the main page where he/she can find the current CoverGirlproducts, its prices, and a description.

When the user clicks "Add", an alert pops up that says "Your item has been added to the cart". 

In the input box that says "Search by Product Type ie 'Lipstick' or 'Blush'", the user can type in the product type he/she is looking for. When he/she does this, the 54 products on the page will reduce to only show the product type the user types into the box, ie. inputting 'Lipstick' will reduce the search to the only 4 lipsticks provided in the CoverGirl Collection.
